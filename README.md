# FLASK BOOKLIST

This project is a Flask-based web application that explores session authentication and middleware while integrating Gulp for asset management. The backend handles user authentication using Flask sessions, enforcing secure login/logout mechanisms, and applying middleware for request validation and logging. Gulp is used to compile and optimize TailwindCSS, manage static assets, and automate development tasks like file watching and minification. This setup provides a structured way to learn about user authentication, middleware functions, and frontend asset management in a Flask environment.
